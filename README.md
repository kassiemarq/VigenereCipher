# VigenereCipher
Project performs the Vigenere Cipher which is a method of encrypting alphabetic text based on substation; the substitution comes in the form of using a key. Typically, one produces Vigenere encryption through looking up a table, however, this program implements math in which each character is mapped to a number like in the following image:
